<h3>Momento</h3>

<p>Momento is my favorite movie of all time. The scenes in black and white are a different direction 
    in time than those shot in color. It's got a great premise and handles the elements well.</p>
<h3>Secondhand Lions</h3>

<p>This movie can eat my ass. It's absolutely fucking stupid from start to finish. </p>
<h3>Finding Nemo</h3>

<p>One fish gets kidnapped by touching a butt, and his daddy fish hangs out with 
    dentistry fish to save his kid. 5 Stars.</p>
