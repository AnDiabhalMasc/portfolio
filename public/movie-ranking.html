<h3>Momento</h3>
<img src=".\Momento.jpg" alt="Memento Movie Poster">
<p>Momento is my favorite movie of all time. The scenes in black and white are a different direction 
    in time than those shot in color. It's got a great premise and handles the elements well.</p>
<h3>Secondhand Lions</h3>
<img src=".\Secondhand Lions.jpg" alt="Secondhand Lions Movie Poster">
<p>This movie is horrible. It has a great actor, but it's terrible from start to finish.</p>
<h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
<img src=".\Finding Nemo.jpg" alt="Finding Nemo Movie Poster">
<p>One fish gets kidnapped by touching a butt, and his daddy fish hangs out with 
    dentistry fish to save his kid. 5 Stars.</p>
