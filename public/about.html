  <h1>About Me</h1>
<a href="../index.html">Home</a>
<hr>
<p>I'm Dakota Hiatt, a self-taught developer driven by a passion for crafting innovative solutions 
  in the dynamic landscape of technology. With 13 years of experience in Software Quality Assurance, 
  I've dedicated myself to ensuring that every product I touch meets the highest standards of excellence. 
  My commitment to precision and efficiency has established me as a trusted professional in the software industry.</p>

<p>Beyond my tech-centric endeavors, I'm a devoted pitbull father and a loving husband. During my downtime, 
  I find joy in tending to my garden and exploring the fascinating world of mycology. 
  As a businessman and entrepreneur, I've successfully translated my expertise into ventures that contribute 
  to the growth of various industries.</p>

<p>I'm not just a tech enthusiast; I'm a versatile individual with a creative side. As an accomplished author,
   I share my insights and experiences through the written word. When I'm not immersed in the digital realm,
    you can find me hiking through nature, setting up camp under the stars, showcasing my vocal talents as a singer,
     or crafting beautiful woodwork creations. My diverse interests and skills make me a well-rounded professional
      with a unique perspective on both the tech world and life beyond the screen.</p>
