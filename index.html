<h3  class="sectionTitle">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>An accomplished professional with 13 years of expertise in Quality Assurance, I bring a robust skill set to the realm of full-stack development, particularly in the MERN stack. Having seamlessly transitioned from a QA role, I have cultivated a deep understanding of software testing principles, automation frameworks, and coding standards. Proficient in JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, I leverage my testing background to ensure the delivery of high-quality, scalable solutions.</p> 
<p>My commitment to problem-solving and a passion for learning is evident in my pivot to development, where I thrive on tackling challenges head-on. A collaborative team player with a keen eye for detail, I am well-versed in Agile methodologies and possess a proven track record of delivering results. Embracing continuous learning, I am enthusiastic about embracing new technologies and contributing to innovative solutions in the ever-evolving landscape of software development.</p>
